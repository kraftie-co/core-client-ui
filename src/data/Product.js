    'MADE TO ORDER Price shown is the cost per coaster. Photos are for illustration purposes only.Midnight FusionHandmade Beautiful Blue, Silver and Gold Resin Coasters:Home accessories tend to make a place feel warmer and more welcoming and so my intentions are to offer products that provide these results. I design and create drinks coasters that are unique and can very simply change the entire atmosphere of a room by adding a small touch of art to a surface.My designs range between the interior décor styles of modern, contemporary, shabby chic, rustic, farmh ouse, monochromatic, geometric, traditional, eclectic and bohemian so there’s plenty for you to choose from!Fashionable coasters can easily convert an already pleasant dining or living area into one that is luxurious, and so you will always be able to host your guests in style.They are stylish but are also functional in that they protect countertops, tables and desks from condensation and other marks that could potentially damage furniture.Perfect gifts for Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Christmas, Birthdays, Housewarming and are also great for your own home.The coasters are made from a resin material. Their sizes range from 3.7 inches up to 5.1 inches in diameter and so are large enough to fit your beverage cups such as coffee, whiskey and teacups. In a set each coaster is a different shape and there is an option to choose either silver, gold or no acrylic sides depending on your preference.Items are typically ready 1-3 working days following an order, however, for busier times please allow 3-5 working days following an order.Feel free to contact me for further information. All suggestions are welcome also.',
